## **Week 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

### **Objective**: 
Engage in the critical phase of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the tools and techniques from Python to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and identify the main structures of your dataset.

### **Instructions**:

#### **1. Univariate Analysis:**
- Load a dataset of your choice in your Colab notebook (you can use one from previous assignments or find a new one).
- Perform univariate analysis to understand the distribution of each variable. This includes calculating measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of spread (range, variance, standard deviation, IQR).
- Visualize the distribution of select numerical variables using histograms.

#### **2. Bivariate Analysis:**
- Analyze the relationship between pairs of variables. 
  - Use scatter plots to explore potential relationships between two numerical variables.
  - For categorical and numerical variable pairs, use boxplots.
- Compute correlation coefficients for numerical variables and document any strong correlations observed.

#### **3. Handling Outliers:**
- Identify outliers in your dataset using the IQR method or visualization tools.
- Decide on an approach to handle these outliers (e.g., remove, replace, or retain) and justify your decision in a markdown cell.

#### **4. Submission**:
- Create a new GitHub repository named `datasci_3_eda` in your GitHub account.
- Organize your GitHub repository with the following:
  - A "datasets" folder containing the dataset you worked on.
  - Save your Colab notebook to your GitHub repository.
  - Submit the link to your GitHub repository.

**Tip**: EDA is more of an art than a strict set of procedures. Feel free to explore and analyze your dataset in any additional ways you find insightful.
