## **Week 8: Classification Techniques**

### **Objective**: 
Get hands-on experience with various classification techniques, understand their principles, and evaluate their performance on real-world datasets.

### **Instructions**:

#### **1. Dataset Selection:**
- Select a dataset suitable for classification. This could be a binary classification or a multi-class dataset.
  
#### **2. Data Preparation:**
- Load the dataset into a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter or Colab).
- Split your data into training and testing sets (typically a 70:30 or 80:20 ratio).
- Ensure any missing data is appropriately handled, and features are scaled or normalized if necessary.

#### **3. Model Implementation:**
- Choose at least three classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, etc.).
- Train each model using your training data.

#### **4. Model Evaluation:**
- Evaluate each model's performance on the test data using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.).
- Display or plot a confusion matrix for each model.

#### **5. Model Interpretation:**
- In markdown cells, provide insights:
  - Briefly explain the rationale behind choosing your dataset and the classification problem it represents.
  - Discuss the performance of each model and the possible reasons for any observed differences in their performance.
  - Offer potential ways of improving the model's performance.

#### **6. Submission**:
- Create a new GitHub repository named `datasci_8_classification` in your GitHub account.
- Organize your GitHub repository with the following:
  - A "datasets" folder containing the dataset you chose.
  - Save your Colab/Jupyter notebook to your GitHub repository.
  - Submit the link to your GitHub repository.

**Tip**: When choosing models, think about the nature of your data and the underlying assumptions of each model. Not all classification techniques might be suitable for your particular dataset.
