## **Week 5: Inferential Statistics**

### **Objective**: 
Dive deep into inferential statistics and understand its relevance in drawing conclusions from data. Apply statistical tests to derive insights and make decisions based on data samples.

### **Instructions**:

You will have to choose either one dataset, or a couple different datasets to conduct a chi-square test, t-test, ANOVA, and regression. You will also have to provide insights on the results of each test. The scripts can be either in a notebook or a python script. You can use python or R, or BOTH! Suggest you do both if you want to maximize your learning.

#### **1. Chi-Square Test:**
- Choose a dataset that contains categorical variables. 
- Formulate a hypothesis related to the relationship between two categorical variables. For instance, if you have a dataset about patients in a hospital, your hypothesis might be "There's an association between the type of treatment a patient receives (e.g., medication, therapy, surgery) and their recovery status (e.g., recovered, not recovered)."
- Clearly state your null and alternative hypotheses. Perform a chi-square test to examine the relationship between these variables and comment on the results.

#### **2. T-Test:**
- Choose a dataset with a numerical health-related feature that can be divided into two groups.
- Formulate a hypothesis comparing the means of this feature between these two groups. For instance, "The average recovery time for patients who underwent surgery is different from those who received medication."
- Clearly state your null and alternative hypotheses. Use the t-test to test your hypothesis and discuss the results.

#### **3. ANOVA:**
- Choose a dataset that contains one numerical health-related variable and a categorical variable with more than two levels/groups.
- Formulate a hypothesis about the means of the numerical variable across the different groups. For example, "The average cholesterol levels differ across patients grouped by diet type (e.g., vegan, vegetarian, omnivore)."
- Clearly state your null and alternative hypotheses. Perform an ANOVA to test your hypothesis and interpret the results.

#### **4. Regression Analysis:**
- Choose a dataset with at least one numerical independent variable and one numerical dependent variable related to healthcare.
- Formulate a hypothesis about the relationship between these variables, such as "The number of hours of physical activity per week predicts a patient's blood pressure level."
- Clearly state your null and alternative hypotheses. Perform a regression analysis to test your hypothesis, and discuss the significance, direction, and strength of the relationship.

#### **5. Markdown Insights:**
- For each section, add a markdown cell below detailing:
  - The rationale behind your choices and tests.
  - Insights or patterns observed from the results.

#### **6. Submission**:
- Create a new GitHub repository named `datasci_5_statistics` in your GitHub account.
- Organize your GitHub repository with the following:
  - A "datasets" folder containing the dataset you worked on. If the datasets are > 50mb for a single file, please post them in a google drive folder that is public, and share that URL.
  - Save your .py script or notebook to your GitHub repository.
  - Submit the link to your GitHub repository.

**Tip**: While performing statistical tests, ensure you understand the assumptions behind each test. This ensures the results you obtain are valid and meaningful in the context of your data.
