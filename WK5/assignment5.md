## **Week 5: Inferential Statistics**

### **Objective**: 
Dive deep into inferential statistics and understand its relevance in drawing conclusions from data. Apply statistical tests to derive insights and make decisions based on data samples.

### **Instructions**:

#### **1. Hypothesis Testing:**
- Choose a dataset (either from previous weeks or a new one). Formulate a hypothesis related to it. For instance, if you have a dataset about a company's employees, your hypothesis might be "The average salary of male employees is greater than that of female employees."
- Use appropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-test, chi-squared test) to test your hypothesis.
- Clearly state your null and alternative hypotheses, and comment on the results of the test.

#### **2. Confidence Intervals:**
- Select a numerical feature from your dataset.
- Calculate and interpret a 95% confidence interval for the mean of that feature. Visualize this interval, if possible.

#### **3. Correlation Analysis:**
- Identify two numerical variables in your dataset.
- Calculate their Pearson correlation coefficient.
- Discuss the strength and direction of the correlation (negative, positive, weak, strong), and what this might imply in the context of your dataset.

#### **4. Markdown Insights:**
- For each section, add a markdown cell below detailing:
  - The rationale behind your choices and tests.
  - Insights or patterns observed from the results.

#### **5. Submission**:
- Create a new GitHub repository named `datasci_5_statistics` in your GitHub account.
- Organize your GitHub repository with the following:
  - A "datasets" folder containing the dataset you worked on.
  - Save your Colab notebook to your GitHub repository.
  - Submit the link to your GitHub repository.

**Tip**: While performing statistical tests, ensure you understand the assumptions behind each test. This ensures the results you obtain are valid and meaningful in the context of your data.
