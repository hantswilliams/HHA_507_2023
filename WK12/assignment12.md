## **Week 12: Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

### **Objective**: 
Understand and apply basic NLP techniques to derive meaningful insights from text data and implement common text processing tasks.

### **Instructions**:

#### **1. Dataset Selection:**
- Find a text dataset of your choice. This could be a collection of news articles, tweets, product reviews, etc.
- Load the dataset into your notebook and display the first few entries.

#### **2. Text Preprocessing:**
- Convert all text to lowercase.
- Remove any punctuations, numbers, and special characters.
- Tokenize the text data.
- Remove stopwords from the tokenized words list.
- Apply stemming or lemmatization to the tokens.

#### **3. Text Visualization:**
- Generate a frequency distribution of words and display the top 20 frequent words.
- Create a word cloud based on word frequencies.

#### **4. Text Analysis:**
- Calculate the sentiment of each entry using any sentiment analysis tool or library of your choice.
- Visualize the overall sentiment distribution (e.g., positive, neutral, negative) in your dataset.

#### **5. Topic Modeling (Optional but Recommended):**
- Use techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify topics within your text data.
- List and describe the main topics you've identified.

#### **6. Interpretation & Reflection:**
- In markdown cells, discuss:
  - The nature of your text data (e.g., domain, tone).
  - Key insights derived from word frequencies and word cloud.
  - The distribution of sentiments and its implications.
  - (If attempted) The topics identified through topic modeling and their relevance.

#### **7. Submission**:
- Create a new GitHub repository named `datasci_12_nlp` in your GitHub account.
- Organize your GitHub repository with the following:
  - A "datasets" folder containing your text dataset.
  - Save your Colab/Jupyter notebook to your GitHub repository.
  - Submit the link to your GitHub repository.
