## **Week 13: Advanced Data Acquisition: APIs and Web-scraping**

### **Objective**: 
Delve into more advanced data acquisition techniques, obtaining data from web sources via APIs and web scraping techniques.

### **Instructions**:

#### **1. API Data Acquisition:**
- Find an open API of your choice (examples: OpenWeather, NewsAPI, REST Countries, etc.).
- Register for an API key if needed.
- Make requests to this API from your notebook, pulling in some relevant data.
- Parse the JSON response to extract useful information.

#### **2. Web Scraping:**
- Choose a website you'd like to scrape data from. Ensure the site's `robots.txt` allows scraping.
- Use libraries like `BeautifulSoup` or `Scrapy` to extract specific data from the website.
- Store the scraped data in a structured format like a dataframe.

#### **3. Data Inspection:**
- Briefly inspect and clean the acquired data, ensuring its consistency and handling any missing values.
- Showcase some basic statistics or visualizations that provide insights about the acquired data.

#### **4. Reflection & Considerations:**
- In markdown cells, discuss:
  - The challenges you faced while working with APIs and web scraping.
  - Ethical considerations associated with web scraping.
  - The nature of the acquired data and potential uses or analyses that can be derived from it.

#### **5. Submission**:
- Create a new GitHub repository named `datasci_13_data_acquisition` in your GitHub account.
- Organize your GitHub repository with the following:
  - A "datasets" folder containing your data if feasible and not too large.
  - Save your Colab/Jupyter notebook to your GitHub repository.
  - Submit the link to your GitHub repository.

**Tip**: Always respect the terms of service of websites. While web scraping can provide valuable data, it's crucial to ethically gather information without causing harm or overloading servers.
