## **Week 10: Unsupervised Learning**

### **Objective**: 
Explore the realm of unsupervised learning, emphasizing clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques to find patterns and groupings within data.

### **Instructions**:

#### **1. Dataset Selection:**
- Choose a dataset that hasn't been labeled, meaning it doesn't have a predefined target variable. This could be the same one from a previous assignment or a new one. 

#### **2. Clustering:**
- Implement at least two clustering methods (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, etc.).
- Visualize the clusters using scatter plots or other relevant visualization techniques.

#### **3. Dimensionality Reduction:**
- Choose a dimensionality reduction technique (e.g., PCA, t-SNE, LLE).
- Apply the technique to your dataset and visualize the results.

#### **4. Interpretation & Analysis:**
- Evaluate the clustering results using silhouette scores or other relevant metrics.
- In markdown cells, provide insights:
  - Discuss the principle behind the clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques you chose.
  - Explain any patterns or groupings observed from the clusters. 
  - Reflect on the significance of the dimensionality reduction results and its implications on the data.

#### **5. Submission**:
- Create a new GitHub repository named `datasci_10_unsupervised` in your GitHub account.
- Organize your GitHub repository with the following:
  - A "datasets" folder containing the dataset you chose.
  - Save your Colab/Jupyter notebook to your GitHub repository.
  - Submit the link to your GitHub repository.

**Tip**: Unsupervised learning often requires a keen eye for interpretation. Patterns and clusters might not always be overtly obvious. Experiment with various parameters to optimize the results.
