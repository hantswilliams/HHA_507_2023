# Deploying Data Visualizations 

**Hants Williams, PhD, RN**

# Importance of Sharing Data

* Data Scientists play a critical role in making data accessible.
* Non-technical audiences need clear, understandable insights.

---

# The ETL Process

* **Extract (E)**: Retrieve raw data from sources.
* **Transform (T)**: Clean, modify, and shape the data into a useful format.
* **Load (L)**: Store back into a database or visualize in a report/dashboard.

---

# Why Visualize?

* Data on its own can be overwhelming and hard to understand.
* Visualization turns complex data into intuitive and actionable insights.
* Helps in decision-making, especially in critical sectors like health.

# Deploying Visualizations

* Beyond creating, **sharing** is key.
* Dashboards: Central platforms to display and interact with your visuals.
* Tools in Python and R enable easy dashboard creation.

# Approaches 

* Jupyuter Notebooks 
* Python and R based Dashboards (Streamlit, Shiny)
* Web Frameworks (Flask, Django, FastAPI)
* Underlining open-source libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, GGPLOT2)
* 3rd party stand alone solutions (Tableau, Power BI)
* Embedded/Integrated BI Tools (Looker, Sisense)
