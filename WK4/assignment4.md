## **Week 4: Data Visualization with Seaborn and Plotly**

### **Objective**: 
Harness the power of Python visualization libraries, Seaborn and Plotly, to create informative and aesthetically pleasing visualizations. Understand how to select the appropriate visualization technique for various types of data.

### **Instructions**:

#### **1. Seaborn Visualizations:**
- Load a dataset of your choice in your Colab notebook. If you don't have a specific dataset in mind, consider using datasets available within Seaborn.
- Create at least the following visualizations using Seaborn:
  - A `pairplot` to visualize relationships between multiple variables.
  - A `heatmap` to visualize correlations or any other suitable matrix data.
  - At least one categorical plot (e.g., `catplot`, `swarmplot`).

#### **2. Plotly Visualizations:**
- Explore the interactive capabilities of Plotly.
- Create the following visualizations using Plotly:
  - A scatter plot with interactive hover details.
  - A bar or column chart representing categorical data.
  - Any other Plotly visualization that you find interesting.

#### **3. Markdown Insights:**
- For each visualization, add a markdown cell below it explaining:
  - Why you chose that specific visualization.
  - Insights or patterns you observed from the visualization.

#### **4. Submission**:
- Create a new GitHub repository named `datasci_4_visualization` in your GitHub account.
- Organize your GitHub repository with the following:
  - A "datasets" folder containing the dataset you worked on.
  - Save your Colab notebook to your GitHub repository.
  - Submit the link to your GitHub repository.

**Tip**: While visualizations should be aesthetically pleasing, the primary goal is to convey information. Always prioritize clarity and understandability in your charts.
