## **Week 6: Regression Analysis**

### **Objective**: 
Get hands-on experience with regression analysis, understanding its principles, and applying it to real-world datasets to predict outcomes and understand relationships between variables.

### **Instructions**:

#### **1. Simple Linear Regression:**
- Choose a dataset and identify two numerical variables: a dependent variable (to be predicted) and an independent variable.
- Fit a simple linear regression model and predict values.
- Visualize the regression line alongside your data points.
- Check the assumptions for the linear regression model.

#### **2. Multiple Linear Regression:**
- Find a dataset that contains at least five continuous variables.
- Choose a dependent variable and multiple independent variables.
- Fit a multiple linear regression model and predict values.
- Discuss the significance of each variable based on their coefficients and p-values. Do they positively or negatively influence the dependent variable?
- Check the assumptions for the multiple regression model.

#### **3. Model Evaluation:**
- Calculate and interpret the R-squared value for your regression model. 
- Discuss the model's adequacy in predicting the dependent variable.

#### **4. Markdown Insights:**
- For each section, add a markdown cell below detailing:
  - The reasoning behind your dataset and variable choices.
  - Any challenges faced during the analysis.
  - Insights or patterns observed from the regression outcomes.

#### **5. Submission**:
- Create a new GitHub repository named `datasci_6_regression` in your GitHub account.
- Organize your GitHub repository with the following:
  - A "datasets" folder containing the dataset you analyzed (if it is under 25 MB). If it is above 25 MB, cite the dataset in the markdown file.
  - Save your Colab notebook with the Python code to your GitHub repository.
  - (Optional) Save a copy of the notebook with R code to your GitHub repository.
  - Submit the link to your GitHub repository.

**Tip**: Regression models come with assumptions (e.g., linearity, independence, homoscedasticity). Make sure you're aware of these when interpreting your results. Also, visualization is key in regression, as it can help in identifying trends and outliers.
