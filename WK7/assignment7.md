## **Week 7: Geospatial Data**

### **Objective**: 
Develop a deep understanding of geospatial data handling and visualization. Acquire skills to process, analyze, and visually represent geographical information in Python.

### **Instructions**:

#### **1. Acquire Geospatial Data:**
- Find a geospatial dataset, preferably one with latitude, longitude, and additional attributes (e.g., temperature, population density, or land use).
  
#### **2. Geospatial Data Processing:**
- Load your dataset into a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter or Colab).
- Perform basic data cleaning, ensuring latitude and longitude values are consistent and accurate.

#### **3. Static Mapping:**
- Utilize a library like `geopandas`, `folium`, or `matplotlib` to generate static maps visualizing your data. 
- Ensure your map provides clear information. This might include color scales for variables or markers for specific locations.

#### **4. Interactive Mapping (Optional but recommended):**
- Generate an interactive map using a library like `folium` or `plotly`. 
- Consider adding interactive components such as pop-ups on markers or zoom capabilities.

#### **5. Analysis Insights:**
- In markdown cells, provide insights:
  - Describe your dataset and its attributes.
  - Highlight any patterns or anomalies you noticed on the map.
  - Explain any decisions you made while visualizing (e.g., why you chose specific colors or markers).

#### **6. Submission**:
- Create a new GitHub repository named `datasci_7_geospatial` in your GitHub account.
- Organize your GitHub repository with the following:
  - A "datasets" folder containing the geospatial dataset you used.
  - Save your Colab/Jupyter notebook to your GitHub repository.
  - Submit the link to your GitHub repository.

**Tip**: Geospatial data often comes in various formats (e.g., Shapefile, GeoJSON, KML). Ensure you understand the format of your dataset and use appropriate methods to load and process it.
