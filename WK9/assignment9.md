## **Week 9: Ensemble Methods and Advanced Models**

### **Objective**: 
Delve into ensemble techniques and more advanced models, understanding how they combine predictions from multiple models to improve overall performance and mitigate overfitting.

### **Instructions**:

#### **1. Dataset Selection:**
- Choose a dataset suitable for classification. It could be the same one from the previous assignment or a new one. 

#### **2. Ensemble Techniques:**
- Implement at least two ensemble methods (e.g., Bagging, Boosting, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, etc.).
- Train each ensemble method using your training data.

#### **3. Advanced Models:**
- Additionally, implement a more advanced machine learning model (e.g., Neural Network, Support Vector Machines with non-linear kernel, etc.).
- Train this model using your training data.

#### **4. Model Evaluation:**
- Evaluate the performance of each ensemble method and the advanced model on test data using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.).
- Compare the performance of the ensemble methods against the advanced model. 

#### **5. Model Interpretation:**
- In markdown cells, provide insights:
  - Explain the principle behind the ensemble techniques you chose.
  - Discuss the performance differences between the ensemble methods and the advanced model. Offer reasons for the observed differences.
  - Suggest potential improvements or other ensemble/advanced techniques that could be applied to this dataset.

#### **6. Submission**:
- Create a new GitHub repository named `datasci_9_ensemble_advanced` in your GitHub account.
- Organize your GitHub repository with the following:
  - A "datasets" folder containing the dataset you chose.
  - Save your Colab/Jupyter notebook to your GitHub repository.
  - Submit the link to your GitHub repository.

**Tip**: Ensemble methods offer a way to combine predictions from multiple models, potentially offering better accuracy. Consider the benefits and drawbacks of each method in relation to the dataset's characteristics.
