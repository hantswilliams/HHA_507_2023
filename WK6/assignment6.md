## **Week 6: ANOVA Analysis Part II**

### **Objective**: 
Gain hands-on experience with ANOVA analysis, understanding its assumptions, and applying it to real-world datasets to understand differences among group means.

### **Instructions**:

#### **1. Data Preparation:**
- Use the dataset from the power point slides that we did not cover in class (2nd one).
- Download the dataset into a Jupyter notebook or a Python/R file.
- For this assignment, you can use either Python or R. For practice, I recommend using both and having/submitting two separate files or notebooks: one for python and one for R.
- Create a subset of the data that includes only the variables of interest.
- Ensure the data types are appropriate: numbers should be numerical and categories should be strings.

#### **2. Assumption Checks:**
- Before conducting the ANOVA, check the following assumptions:
  - **Normality**: Test for the normal distribution of your dependent variable within each group using suitable statistical tests (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk). 
    - **Interpretation**: Please interpret the p-value from the test.
  - **Homoscedasticity (Equal Variances)**: Check if the variances of the different groups are equal using the Levene's test.
    - **Interpretation**: Please interpret the p-value from the test.

#### **3. Conduct the ANOVA:**
- Using the stats package or a similar library, conduct the one-way ANOVA on your data.
- Interpret the p-value from the test and what the results mean.

#### **4. Post-hoc Test (if necessary):**
- If your ANOVA result is significant, follow up with a Tukey post-hoc test to determine which groups differ from each other.
- Interpret the result of the Tukey test, highlighting which groups have significant differences.

#### **5. Markdown Insights:**
- For each section, add a markdown cell below detailing:
  - The reasoning behind your dataset and variable choices.
  - Any challenges faced during the analysis.
  - Insights or patterns observed from the ANOVA outcomes.

#### **6. Submission**:
- Create a new GitHub repository named `datasci_6_anova` in your GitHub account.
- Organize your GitHub repository with the following:
  - A "datasets" folder containing the dataset you analyzed.
  - Save your Jupyter notebook or Python/R file to your GitHub repository.
  - Submit the link to your GitHub repository.

**Tip**: Like other statistical tests, ANOVA comes with its own set of assumptions. Make sure you're aware of these and check them before interpreting your results. Visualization can be beneficial in understanding the distribution and relationships in ANOVA. Consider plotting boxplots or histograms for visual checks.
