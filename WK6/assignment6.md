## **Week 6: Regression Analysis**

### **Objective**: 
Get hands-on experience with regression analysis, understanding its principles, and applying it to real-world datasets to predict outcomes and understand relationships between variables.

### **Instructions**:

#### **1. Simple Linear Regression:**
- Choose a dataset and identify two numerical variables: a dependent variable (to be predicted) and an independent variable.
- Split the data into a training set and a testing set.
- Fit a simple linear regression model to the training data and predict values for the testing data.
- Visualize the regression line alongside your data points.

#### **2. Multiple Linear Regression:**
- Extend the previous task by adding one or more additional independent variables to your model.
- Discuss the significance of each variable based on their coefficients. Do they positively or negatively influence the dependent variable?

#### **3. Model Evaluation:**
- Calculate and interpret the R-squared value for your regression model. 
- Discuss the model's adequacy in predicting the dependent variable.
- Use other metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to further evaluate the model's performance.

#### **4. Markdown Insights:**
- For each section, add a markdown cell below detailing:
  - The reasoning behind your dataset and variable choices.
  - Any challenges faced during the analysis.
  - Insights or patterns observed from the regression outcomes.

#### **5. Submission**:
- Create a new GitHub repository named `datasci_6_regression` in your GitHub account.
- Organize your GitHub repository with the following:
  - A "datasets" folder containing the dataset you analyzed.
  - Save your Colab notebook to your GitHub repository.
  - Submit the link to your GitHub repository.

**Tip**: Regression models come with assumptions (e.g., linearity, independence, homoscedasticity). Make sure you're aware of these when interpreting your results. Also, visualization is key in regression, as it can help in identifying trends and outliers.
